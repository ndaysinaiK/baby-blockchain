  - baby-blockchain
      - AddNet : add decentralization and fault tolerance 
      - AddPersistence : data persistence

## Run it

- git clone https://github.com/ndaysinaiK/baby-blockchain
- cd baby-blockchain/frontend
- npm i
- cd baby-blockchain/baby-blockchain/Simple : for the first implementation
- go build
- run 
- run ./blockchain : this will run the app on port 3002 ( may shut down any app running on that port)
- open the frontend folder, search for https://bch-simple.herokuapp.com in Utils/Apis.js and replace it with http://localhost:3002
- go to http://localhost:3002/api to see your api running.
- cd baby-blockchain/frontend 
- npm start : this will open the reactjs app in your local browser. Test and improve it.
