â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ Simple          - First and Simple implementation (No data persistence: Data disapears after reload) built in Go
â””â”€â”€ frontend            - Frontend built in React (js)
```


## Prerequisites

 - go installed
 - nodejs installed
 
## Run it

### Backend

```sh
cd backend/Simple
cp dotenv.tpl .env      # create a .env file from template
go build                # build application
./blockchain            # run the application on the port specified in .env (defaults to 3002 - may shut down any app running on that port)
```

Go to `http://localhost:3002/api` to see your api running.

### Frontend

```sh
cd frontend
npm install
npm start               # this will open the reactjs app in your default browser (localhost:3000 by default).
```

Go to http://localhost:3000 to see your frontend running.
Note: Backend url is specified in `Utils/Apis.js`
